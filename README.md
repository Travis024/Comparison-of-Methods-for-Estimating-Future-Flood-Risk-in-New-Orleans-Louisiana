# Comparison-of-Methods-for-Estimating-Future-Flood-Risk-in-New-Orleans-Louisiana
A summer research project conducted by Anthony Wong and Travis Torline at the University of Colorado Boulder

This project will use sea level data from New Orleans, Louisiana to make improved projections of flood risk throughout the 21st century. The currently-used calculation of flood hazard relies on some “magic numbers”. We will estimate appropriate values for those parameters using an independent and statistically rigorous approach.

As sea levels and storm surges rise due to climate change, this project will highlight important modeling uncertainties and provide recommendations for augmenting the flood protection system in New Orleans. These results will benefit the flood risk modeling community as well as the local population of New Orleans.
