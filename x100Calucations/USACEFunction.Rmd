#This process takes four steps:
#1) Sample a sea-level rise simulation and compute the change in sea level (2016 to 2065)
#2) Sample stationary GEV parameters and compute Xrp (rp = return period)
#3) Sample a surge factor from a unifrom distribution
#4) Construct a realization of X'rp as Xrp + Surge Factor * Change in Sea Level

#To begin, we must load in the necessary data:
#Sea level data
#Stationary GEV parameters
#A time vector

library(extRemes)
library(ncdf4)

#The following loads in the sea level data
#LSL 85 has 12,586 sea level projections from 1850 to 2100
ncin <- nc_open("../ncdfFiles/SeaLevelData.nc")

#This data is in meters, so multipy by 1000 to get millimeters
LSL85 <- ncvar_get(ncin, "LocalSeaLevel_gamma_RCP85")
LSL85 <- LSL85 * 1000

#The following loads in a time vector

nc_close(ncin)

#The following loads in the stationary GEV parameters
params1 <- read.csv(file="../parameters_data/Data Frames/params1.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",") #All stationary

#Now we create our function, which will complete the 4 steps outlined above
#As inputs, it will take seaLevelData, statParams, timeProj, iterations, yearStart, yearEnd, returnPeriod, uniformStart, and uniformEnd
#seaLevelData = sea level projections IN MILIMETERS
#statParams = stationary GEV parameters IN MILIMETERS
#timeProj = a vector of years for which there is sea level data
#iterations = how many times to go through the above 4 steps
#yearStart = starting year for sea level change
#yearEnd = ending year for sea level change
#returnPeriod = The yearly magnitude of the storm (example, a 1 in 100 year storm has a return period of 100)
#uniformStart = the starting number for the uniform distribution
#uniformEnd = the ending number for the uniform distribution
